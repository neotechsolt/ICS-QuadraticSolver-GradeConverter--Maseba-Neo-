# ICS-Quadratic-Grader--Maseba-Neo-
This repository contains the assignment which involves making an html file which encapacitates javaScript functions for calculating quadratic equations and a grade calculator
## features
- Quadratic equation solver (-b ± (√b² - 4ac)/2a)
- Grade conveter (0 -- 100 marks to letter grade)
- input validation and error handling
- responsive design
### Quaddratic solver:
- a=1, b=-3, c=2 → roots: 2,1
- a=1, b=4, c=4 → roots: -2 (repeated)
-  a=1, b=2, c=5 → roots: complex roots
### grade conveter
- 85-100 → A⁺
- 75-84 → A
- 65-74 → B⁺
- 60-64 → B
- 55-59 → C⁺
- 50-54 → C
- 0-49 → D
## How to run
1. Download the 'index.html'
2. Open it any web browser
3. use the forms to solve the equation or convert to grade letter
